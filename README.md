## Architecture

This project follows professional software development practices with a clean, modular architecture:

### Design Patterns
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has one focused purpose
- **Dependency Injection**: Components are loosely coupled
- **Observer Pattern**: Game state management

## Architecture

### Code Quality & Testing
- **Test Coverage**: 38.5% and growing with comprehensive test suite
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clean architecture with distinct layers
- **Component-Based Rendering**: Modular rendering system with specialized components
- **Path Smoothing**: Advanced mathematical algorithms for smooth snake curves
- **OOP Best Practices**: Proper encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism

### Refactored Architecture
The codebase has been refactored to follow modern software engineering principles:

#### Rendering Components
- **SnakeBodyRenderer**: Handles snake body rendering with proper proportions and 3D effects
- **SnakeHeadRenderer**: Specialized head rendering with realistic features (eyes, tongue, nostrils)
- **SnakeScaleRenderer**: Manages scale patterns and texture details
- **PathSmoother**: Advanced curve generation using Catmull-Rom splines

#### Design Patterns
- **Component Pattern**: Rendering system broken into specialized components
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different rendering strategies for different snake parts
- **Factory Pattern**: Fruit creation and management
- **Observer Pattern**: Game state change notifications

#### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing with mocks
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-component interaction testing
- **Coverage Reporting**: Automated coverage tracking and reporting
- **Continuous Testing**: Test suite runs on every change
